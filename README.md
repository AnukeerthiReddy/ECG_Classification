# ECG Signal Classification Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks
### Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, are the leading causes of death worldwide. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), 90% of patients are unaware of their high risk before experiencing a cardiac event. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial to improving treatment outcomes.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals represent the heart's electrical activity and are widely used for detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias. This project focuses on automating the interpretation of ECG signals using machine learning and neural networks, leveraging IoT, Big Data Processing, and Health Monitoring Systems (HMS) for accurate arrhythmia detection.

### Objective
The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying ECG signals into five categories:

Normal Beat (N)
Atrial Premature Beat (S)
Premature Ventricular Contraction (V)
Fusion Beat (F)
Paced Beat (Q)
This model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a reliable tool for early detection and classification of cardiac abnormalities, expediting diagnoses and interventions.

### Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which contains 109,446 ECG samples across five categories. The data is sampled at a frequency of 125Hz and has the following class distribution:

Normal Beat (N): 82.8%
Atrial Premature Beat (S): 0.7%
Premature Ventricular Contraction (V): 5.1%
Fusion Beat (F): 0.7%
Paced Beat (Q): 10.7%
To address the class imbalance, upsampling techniques were employed to ensure the model was not biased towards the majority class.

### Approach
Given the temporal nature of ECG signals, traditional machine learning models may struggle to capture intricate patterns. Therefore, advanced models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers were used to handle sequential information. These architectures are well-suited for capturing the temporal patterns inherent in ECG data.

### Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Upsampling was used to balance the dataset.
Feature Scaling was applied to ensure the data was normalized for the model.
###Model Architectures
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Neural Networks:
CNN+LSTM Model:
Convolutional Layers: Three layers with ReLU activation, followed by Batch Normalization and MaxPooling1D.
LSTM Layer: The output of the CNN layers is fed into an LSTM layer to capture the temporal dependencies.
### Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall classification performance.
Precision, Recall, F1-score: For each class.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize classification performance.
### Results
The developed model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying ECG signals into their respective classes. Through the use of CNN and LSTM layers, the model effectively captured temporal patterns, significantly improving prediction performance.

### Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of machine learning and neural networks in healthcare, particularly for the early detection and classification of cardiac arrhythmias. The automated system developed here offers a powerful tool for clinicians to identify high-risk patients and provide timely interventions.

### Future Work
